    "description": "Industrial Economics is the study of firms, industries and markets. Thus, the aim of this course is to provide students with an understanding of theoretical models of firm behaviour and of empirical approaches to testing such models.  The first part concentrates on understanding firm’s behaviours in different market structures.  We will also introduce key concepts in game theory and then apply them to some specific industrial economics models.  The second part of the course focuses on empirical analysis in industrial economics.  We will look at studies of structure and firm/industry performance, dealing with relevant measurement and econometric issues.",
