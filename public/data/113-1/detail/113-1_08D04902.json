    "description": "This course aims to help students expand vocabulary, develop reading skills and reading comprehension through reading a wide variety of articles related to our local cultures; meanwhile, students can link the reading texts to practice writing skills and are able to write at least two-paragraph long cohesive essays. By revising the drafts of their own writing, students will also gain self-editing experience. Since the reading texts are related to the local history and cultures of Taiwan, this course also prepares the students to become a global citizen with the perspectives of glocalization as well as consciousness of Taiwanization.",
