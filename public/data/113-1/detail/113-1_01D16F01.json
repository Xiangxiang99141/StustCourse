    "description": "人類文明如何發展至今？何以近400年來改變如此迅速？人們在想些什麼？理念為何？<br>當代哲學受哥白尼、伽利略及牛頓之科學觀影響，也繼續影響未來世界；其效應及於當前每一個生活領域、每一個人與每一件事；渠等對自然與真理的質疑，帶領人類進行各個思想領域的革命，包括尼采所宣稱的：「上帝已死」。<br>How did we get to where we are today? Why has the world changed so much in the last 400 years? What were people thinking? What were their ideas?<br>The world of modern philosophy influences and is influenced by the science of Copernicus, Galileo and Newton. These men had a huge effect on everyone and everything that was to follow. It is with their questioning of nature and truth that was to lead to the revolutions in all areas of thought to the present day, and Nietzsche’s declaration: “God is dead.”",
