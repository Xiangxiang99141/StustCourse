    "description": "The objective of this course is to enhance the statistical data analytic ability for PhD students majored in business or social sciences, to help them analyze their research data appropriately. <br><br>The course content covers not only methodologies for analyzing the cross-sectional data but also those for analyzing the longitudinal data (time series, panel data, etc.). Because some of these techniques are rather advanced, students are expected to have some background in elementary statistical data analysis. <br><br>We will emphasize the concept of every given technique and its use, will demonstrate its application by examples, and will help students learn how to interpret the resulting output obtained from the widely used statistical package SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) , AMOS (Analysis of moment structures), STATA (statistical software for data science), and HLM (Hierarchical Linear Modeling), etc.",
