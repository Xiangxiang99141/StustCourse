    "description": "Managers need to develop their interpersonal or people skills if they are going to be effective in their jobs. Organizational behavior (OB) is a field of study that investigates the impact that individuals, groups, and structure have on behavior within an organization, and then applies that knowledge to improve an organization’s effectiveness. Because OB is concerned with employment-related situations, it emphasizes behavior on the job, absenteeism, employment turnover, productivity, human performance and management. Organizational behavior offers both challenges and opportunities for managers. It recognizes differences and helps managers to see the value of workforce diversity and practices that may need to be changed when managing in different countries.",
