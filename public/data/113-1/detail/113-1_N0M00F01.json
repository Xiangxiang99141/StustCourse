    "description": "This course is the second part of a sequence of statistical data analytic courses: “Multivariate Data Analysis (MDA)”, and “Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)”.  Materials covered in the sequence consist of multivariate statistical methods, and structural equation models. SEM is often referred to as the second generation of MDA. These courses are to help students, primarily from business and social sciences, learn the application of the basics of the SEM.  We will emphasize the concept of every given technique and its use, and will help students learn how to interpret the resulting output obtained from the widely used statistical package SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) and AMOS (Analysis of moment structures).<br><br>The application of each statistical method in solving managerial problem will be demonstrated by examples. Exercises and assignments are then given for practices; students will be asked to produce computer outputs and interpret analysis results.",
